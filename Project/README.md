The requirements for the database can be found in the file

## First, we had to make ERD for our future database.

I got it like this.

## Then we needed to fill our tables with data. I used the [Mockaroo] service.

## After that, we checked the correctness of our database, using the queries that you can find below

## All DDL and DML command can be viewd in the file

[DDL.sql] and [DML.sql]

## All queries that I used to check the database can be found below

[Queries.sql]

## ERD can be found in

[ERD]
